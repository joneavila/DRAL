function paddedPitch = ...
    lookUpOrComputePitchModified(trackDirectory, trackFilename, signal, sampleRate)
% LOOKUPORCOMPUTEPITCHMODIFIED Return a vector of pitch points and a vector
% of where they are, in ms.

% This function is modified from Mid-level Toolkit LOOKUPORCOMPUTEPITCH
% with the following changes:
%   * Remove fallback to fxrapt. Instead read REAPER F0 files else raise an
%     error.
%   * Remove FILE1ISOLDER function since they were only used when falling
%     back to fxrapt.
%   * Remove code relateÂ to separate channels and assume input file is mono
%   * Assume no "trimmable" files.
%   * Remove PADDEDCENTERS output argument since it is not used by
%     GETLOWLEVEL.
%   * Add padding so that PADDEDPITCH matches expected length.

% REAPER F0 files are expected in a subdirectory named "f0reaper", in the
% same directory containing the audio. The audio's REAPER F0 file is
% expected to have the same basename.

% EST_Header_End
