% COMPUTECPPSMODIFIED This function modifies Midlevel Toolkit COMPUTECPPS
% to reduce the number of spectrogram windows computed by a factor of 5 (as
% tested by TIMECPPSFUNCTIONS) and add extra padding to the return
% `CPPS_midlevel` so that each 10 ms of `signal` has a CPPS value. This
% modified function is not used; it did not have a strong correlation with
% the original function, as tested by PLOTCPPSFUNCTIONS.
%
%   See also COMPUTECPPS, PLOTCPPSFUNCTIONS.
